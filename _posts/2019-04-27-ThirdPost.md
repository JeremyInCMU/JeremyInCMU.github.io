**Aluminum Pedestrain Bridge**

Last year, I was told to join a group focusing on aluminum pedestrain bridge. Out team will keep an eye on aluminum pedestrain bridge after work. From that day, I began to search information of aluminum pedestrain bridge through internet. Aluminum attract people's attention because it is steel's brother. In the early day, people optimistically regarded aluminum as replacement of steel. But aluminum disappointed those guys since its elastic module is much smaller than steel eventhough its strength is almost equal to steel. Smaller elastic module means smaller stiffness. From the persepctive of a structure engineer, truss is the best structure type for aluminum as it can largely increase stiffness of aluminum. And at beginning of this month, a colleage a gudy who focuses on structures' appearance optimization and I was assigned to design an aluminum pedestrain bridge in Shenzhen. The purpose of this bridge is connecting two commercial center on each side of an urban highway. Challenge of this project is the bridge's appearnce. The customers agree on advantage of aluminum pedestrain bridge. However, they can't bear the truss structure. They need more beautiful appearance which can be harmoney with the surroundings. Besides, the width of pedestrain bridge is supposed to be so large that it will natrually connects building platforms at both ends of the bridge. For other materials like steel, the width is not definitely not a big deal. But for aluminum, large width means large stiffness of sections. After viewing references, I realized that finished aluminum pedestrain bridges are less narrow. It means we have almost no reference when solving this problem. The only way to solve this problem is create a new way.  In the past weeks, I thought through it day and night. 

Finally, I deployed truss arch to help improving stiffness of each span while ...
