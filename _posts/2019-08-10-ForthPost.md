**Parametric Design for Ancient Chinese Pedestrain Bridge**

In the past days, I am gradually familiar with parametric design based on a gogerous software - rhino and a gogerous plug-in grasshopper. The plug-in was actually designed for interface programming and I mainly deploy the script entrance of this plug-in which is based on Python, one of my favorite programming language. 

I realize that with those kind of tools, parametrical design can be done. Those features of rhino and grasshopper actually sounds like features of revit and dynamo. But there is difference between those softwares and plug-ins. Rhino is basically designed for architectures to find accurate 3D geometries and grasshopper makes this feature more powerful. However, the revit focuses on data of buildings and the dynamo at some level makes it more powerful. Those softwares have their own outstanding features. One for graphic computation and the other for data storing and management. I am a structre engineer in a big structure design company. As I know, most peopole in my company misunderstand about the concept of BIM and revit. They are trying to regard revit as a outstanding 3d modeling tool. Actually the power of revit is more than that. 

In this project, I will show my first parametric design project based on rhino. May be it is kind of naive, but it has the spirit of parametric design. 

At first, the result is coming up
<div>
	<img class = "image" src = "{{site.url}}/assets/img/2019-09-30/1.png" alt = "alt text"/>
	<figcaption class = "caption"> Made by Jiaming Xiao </figcaption>
</div>

Here comes the steps before getting the final result

Step 1: 

Create upper archs of the pedestrain bridge based on nodes in grasshopper.

<div>
	<img class = "image" src = "{{site.url}}/assets/img/2019-09-30/2.png" alt = "alt text"/>
	<figcaption class = "caption"> Made by Jiaming Xiao </figcaption>
</div>

Actually, I tried my best to deploy built in nodes of grasshopper since it could be easily understand by most people.

Step 2:

Create lower archs of the pedestrain bridge based on nodes in grasshopper.

<div>
	<img class = "image" src = "{{site.url}}/assets/img/2019-09-30/3.png" alt = "alt text"/>
	<figcaption class = "caption"> Made by Jiaming Xiao </figcaption>
</div>

Step 3:

Create horizontal connection along archs.

<div>
	<img class = "image" src = "{{site.url}}/assets/img/2019-09-30/4.png" alt = "alt text"/>
	<figcaption class = "caption"> Made by Jiaming Xiao </figcaption>
</div>

Step 4:

Create surface for horizontal connection archs. 

<div>
	<img class = "image" src = "{{site.url}}/assets/img/2019-09-30/5.png" alt = "alt text"/>
	<figcaption class = "caption"> Made by Jiaming Xiao </figcaption>	
</div>
