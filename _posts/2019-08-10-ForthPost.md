**Parametric Design for Ancient Chinese Pedestrain Bridge**

Last time, I mentioned that I found rhino and grasshopper which is like a gate of another new word. I began to hang out with rhino and grasshopper. During this period, I found that those stuffs are amazing. Rhino is a very powerful 3d modeling software. The core function can help people build gogerous and complex models. In a meeting, I saw a beautiful case for a chinese traditional pedestrain wooden bridge. And then I tried to build a model in grasshopper. It is not just a 3d model but a parametric 3d model which means the dimension of the whole bridge and sections can change while changing parametrics. What's interesting is that the revised 3d model can be presented in the grasshopper real time. It is definitely a pefect feature for designers who usually revise their design frequently.
