**Hang out with Rhino && Grasshopper**

Recently, I was hanging out with Rhino and Grasshopper. It is pretty interesting when trying to create fascinating shape by coding. Grasshopper and Dynamo which are the similar plugin for 3D modeling softwares.
It is not just plugins but tendency of programming in architecture design. In the old days, creating 3D modeling cost much time of engineers and designers. And it is inevitable to revise 3D models which means disaster of engineers and designers who created the 3D model. And most of their work will be meaningless and time-consuming. Graashopper and Dynamo introduced parametric modeling. It looks like the OOP in computer science. The 3D model is assembled by pieces of nodes. The models are more adpative. It frees both engineers and designers' hands and minds so that they can pay more attention on design not modeling. 

This month, I hang out with rhino after work. I suppose to deploy parameter design concept to make the bridge
I design alive. Later, I will upload the codes I wrote while creating a dynamic 3D model for the pedestrain bridge I designed. 3D modeling is absolutely not a big deal today but a dynamic one under control of parameters
is interesting which means designers can change the object they design by adjusting parameters without any extra-operation like what they did in the past. And finally I suppose to import this 3d model into lumion recently introduced by my colleages is an easy to use software. It is pretty simple like playing a city simulaton game. We will see what I get in the end. Hope to share my work soon.
