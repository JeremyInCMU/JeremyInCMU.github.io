** Ideas about my future work **

Three days ago, I found a book named Algorithimc Architecture when viewing a post through my cellphone. The title attracted me at that moment since it is coincident with my expectation about the future of architecture and structural design. That is also the reason why I finally made up my mind to be a structure
engineer after graduating from CMU. Actually, most of my classmates prefer to be an IT guy working in Silicon Valley after graduation. I still remember the day I started working in the office of the structure design company. It looks like I travelled from modern society to an ancient one by a time machine. For most desktops, the operating systems are windows 7 and the most popular tools are Autodesk CAD 2010 and the microsoft excel.
But the truth is I did not. Unlike technical companies and IT companies, architecture and structure techniques fell back in the past decade.

But I found things are totally different when diving into the design work. Slow development sometime means more opportunities to change. Design is a sort of logic expression. Like human thought, there are two independent parts -- ration and emotion. It is pretty hard to teach computer think emotionally though I have found engineers in google was trying to teach computers understand emotional thoughts. But it looks like not that hard to teach computers understand rational thought. Structure design is the rational part of design. There is always an explanation and logic drives people design the structures around us. Theoretically, it is approachable to teach computers understand the logic of structure design. But, paractially, we need to be patient about establishing connection between digit and structures. The cost of structure digitize is much larger beyond estimate.
