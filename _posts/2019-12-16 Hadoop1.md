When I studied in Carnegie Mellon, I heard about the cloud computing course. In the course, students learn hadoop to clean big data with free amazon account since they will deploy the amazon EC2 and S3 servers to distributedly clean data on tens of computer servers. That course attracted me a lot when I was in the course of algorithm and computer systems. In the last
semester, I prefer to the wireless sensor network course rather than the cloud computing. Today, I regret to the decision I made. However, there is always a chance. Recently, I found the book named hadoop the definitive guide 4th edition which focuses on Hadoop2. Although I heard some bad news for hadoop, I still want to learn hadoop by myself with the book. Each time I learn something from it, I will try to update my feelings on my blog as soon as possible. This is the first day, I sit in front of my desktop and start reading this book. 

Carpe Diem!
